Task: Create a Program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically.

Overview: This repository Contains python code for solving sudoku puzzles and it uses backtracing algorithm to find the missing number. The backtracking method is a trial-and-error approach, placing numbers in empty cells and recursively progressing. If a placement leads to a dead end, it backtracks to the previous step and tries a different number until the puzzle is solved or deemed unsolvable.

Result: Through the Backtracing approach,Each number from 1 to 9 is placed such that every row, every column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the numbers from 1 to 9, meeting the requirements of a solved Sudoku puzzle.
